sc2replay-csharp
================
#### C# library for extracting player and game information from .sc2replay files. ####

This is an easy-to-use library to quickly parse and extract information from the undocumented .sc2replay format. The project has a side goal of creating an in-depth wiki with replay file documentation.

Current Abilities
================
* Parses basic player and matchup information.
* Parses entire chat log.
* Can insert lines of text into the chat log for any player.
* Can clear the in-game chat for a "clean" replay.

You can find and contribute information in deconstructing the file format in the wiki: <https://github.com/ascendedguard/sc2replay-csharp/wiki>
